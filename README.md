# Mana Cook
## About
Learning to cook is time-consuming, arduous, and often fraught with failure, especially for the young adult just out of school. Why not make the process like an RPG with a level system? Mana Cook will exist so novice cooks can learn in easy steps with a leveling system that offers recipes based on experience in ingredients, techniques, and equipment. As players level up, they can unlock recipes that gradually become more difficult to increase the player's confidence at a comfortable pace. Recipes will be presented step-by-step with notifications.
